    <P>This song was the final for my Muisc Concepts class. This class was an introduction to music theory for music producers. I have a background in music, so this class was pretty easy for me, but I still feel like I learned a lot about composing music in this class.</P>

    <p>This project was the final for my Recording and Sampling class. We were given free reign to make anything we wanted and I chose to do a Foley project. This was my second attempt at a foley (the first one being the one you see below).</p>

    <p>This song was an assignment for my music concepts class. We were learning to write melody and my professor said I should sumbit this song to an event called ReggieCon. This event has a section that included an Audio and Music Prodcution student showcase. I submitted my song and it was accepted to the event and was played at the event.</p>

    <p>This song was the final produce from one of my recording and sampling class. We were tasked wtih making a boombap beat. My group chose to make the beat out of things you would find in a school. We used pencils as drumsticks and hit waterbottles, desks, and other classroom items.</p>

    <p>This was the final product of my very first recording and sampling project. We were tasked with making a Foley Narrative. My group went for a camping themed narrative and we were very proud of the final product.</p>
